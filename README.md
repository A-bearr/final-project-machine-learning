Goals:

The goal of this project is not to act as a substitute for your own intuition and knowledge before commiting to a stock, it is to act as a tool to help the user more easily recognize patterns that have occured in the price throughout time, although the predicted values may not be identical to the actual daily high, it is a good indicator of whether the expected value of the stock will increase or decrease.
